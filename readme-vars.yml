  ### Hardware Acceleration Enhancements

  This section lists the enhancements we have made for hardware acceleration in this image specifically.

  #### OpenMAX (Raspberry Pi)

  Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi MMAL/OpenMAX will need to mount their `/dev/vcsm` and `/dev/vchiq` video devices inside of the container and their system OpenMax libs by passing the following options when running or creating the container:

  ```text
  --device=/dev/vcsm:/dev/vcsm
  --device=/dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq
  -v /opt/vc/lib:/opt/vc/lib
  ```

  #### V4L2 (Raspberry Pi)

  Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi V4L2 will need to mount their `/dev/video1X` devices inside of the container by passing the following options when running or creating the container:

  ```text
  --device=/dev/video10:/dev/video10
  --device=/dev/video11:/dev/video11
  --device=/dev/video12:/dev/video12
  ```
