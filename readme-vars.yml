# application setup block

  Webui can be found at `http://<your-ip>:8096`

  Emby has very complete and verbose documentation located [here](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki) .

  Hardware acceleration users for Intel Quicksync and AMD VAAPI will need to mount their /dev/dri video device inside of the container by passing the following command when running or creating the container:

  ```--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri```

  We will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device.

  Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here:

  https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker
  
  We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime `--runtime=nvidia` and add an environment variable `-e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv` ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the emby docker.

  ### OpenMAX (Raspberry Pi)
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi OpenMAX will need to mount their /dev/vchiq video device inside of the container and their system OpenMax libs by passing the following options when running or creating the container:
  ```
  --device=/dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq
  -v /opt/vc/lib:/opt/vc/lib
  ```

  ### V4L2 (Raspberry Pi)
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi V4L2 will need to mount their /dev/video1X devices inside of the container by passing the following options when running or creating the container:
  ```
  --device=/dev/video10:/dev/video10
  --device=/dev/video11:/dev/video11
  --device=/dev/video12:/dev/video12
  ```
